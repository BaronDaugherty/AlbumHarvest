# AlbumHarvest
Harvests all albums from a specified imgur user

This was a small script I wrote up one night to learn about beautiful soup for python.
Rather than use an API we do things the "hard way."

Prompts the user for an imgur username
Prompts the user for a folder to save to (e.g. "C:\pictures\")
Scrapes all of the album names from a user's page
Scrapes each of the album pages for pictures
Writes the pictures to disk in individual album folders

Is it ugly? Oh yeah.
Is it slow? You bet.
Does it work? Until imgur changes the format of their pages!
